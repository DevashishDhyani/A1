# SPLit
![](https://i.imgur.com/qXONyae.jpg)
When on a trip or vacation, it's very likely that multiple people will make various expenses on behalf of the entire group or a subset of the group.
To keep all the expenses accounted for verbally is almost an impossible task. Hence, our team decided to make a web application which keeps track of all 
such payments. In the end, the aim is to calculate and display what each member owes based on how much they have spent during the trip and on what things.

Due to time constraints, our group has managed to split a bill where a single person makes the payment on behalf of the group (for example, at a dinner reservation). 
All other members present have to then owe the person who paid the entire bill.

Future work includes extending the web app to allow budgeting and scenarios where multiple pay on an entire trip (as opposed to just a single bill which 
we currently have implemented).
